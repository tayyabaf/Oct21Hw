        // be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces.

        //Object is the super class of all other classes, so using Object as a reference can refer to any object
            //This lacks type-safety
            //Generics allow us to have type-safety

        //There are 2 main types of Java Generics, which are Generic Methods and Generic Classes
        //Generic methods have type paramterers which are cited by actual type allowing the generic method to be used in a more geenral way
        //Generic class has a type paramter section. There can be multiple types which are separated by a comma

        //In Parameter type we can not use primitives like ‘int’,’char’ or ‘double’
