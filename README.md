# Generics
>Generics allow the author of a class or method to introduce type parameters, which are symbols that can be substituted for any concrete type
>Generics allow us to create classes that work with different data types

>With generics, you can create type-safe collections where more problems are caught at compile-time instead of runtime

>The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, etc, and user-defined types) to  be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces.

>Object is the super class of all other classes, so using Object as a reference can refer to any object
>>This lacks type-safety
> 
>>Generics allow us to have type-safety

>In Parameter type we can not use primitives like int, char, or double

>3 main things to know about Generics
> >1. Creating instances of generified classes
> >>Example: When u make an arraylist, u have to tell it the type of objects u will allow in the list
>
> >2. Declaring and aissigning variables of generic types
> 
> >3. Declaring and invoking methods that take generic types

> A generic class means that the *class declaration* includes a type parameter
> 
> A generic method means that the method declaration uses a type paramter in its singature

>In generics, "extends" means "extends or implements"
